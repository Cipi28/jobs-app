# Laravel Backend Code (Reference Only)

This folder contains the Laravel backend code for reference and modification purposes.
The code here is NOT executed - it's only for development and planning.

## Structure
- `app/` - Laravel application code
- `routes/` - API routes
- `database/` - Migrations and seeders
- `config/` - Configuration files

## Workflow
1. Add your Laravel files to this folder
2. When implementing new features, both frontend and backend code will be modified
3. Copy the backend changes from here to your actual Laravel project
4. Test the integration between frontend and your local backend

## Current API Base URL
The frontend is currently configured to use: `https://jobs-api-1pqa.onrender.com/api/v1/`
